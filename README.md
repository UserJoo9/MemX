# MemX


MemX is a lightweight and efficient memory cleaner tool designed to help optimize your Windows system's performance by clearing unnecessary memory usage, particularly the standby list.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Efficient Memory Cleaning**: Targets and clears the standby memory list to free up valuable RAM.
* **Automated Operation**: Includes a script to potentially integrate with system startup for continuous optimization.
* **Simple and Focused**: A straightforward tool dedicated to memory management.

## üöÄ How it Works

MemX primarily leverages the `EmptyStandbyList.exe` utility, which is a known tool for clearing the standby memory list on Windows systems. 

The `details.py` file plays a crucial role in managing the paths to various application resources, and `AutoStartup.py` handles the logic for automatic execution.
